            <p>Hello, I'm Dave.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My wife Heidi and I thought it would be great to get a tent trailer so we could travel more and to distant locations - much further than the three state area where we had grown up. The only problem was we owned two hybrid SUVs that had towing limits of 1500 pounds. We were unable to find a trailer that would fill our needs and could be towed by our SUV without killing its transmission and voiding the warranty. Our son Joseph mentioned that van conversions are a very popular way of camping and travelling so we begin the van conversion journey.</p>

            <p>With the help of Joseph, Heidi, and the web I spent a couple of months watching YouTube, looking at Pinterest, and reading quite a few articles dealing with the DIYs (Do it Yourselves) of van conversions. I won't go into the details of why we bought the van we did or the changes we are making, because our needs are different just as everyone who reads this Blog is different. Read on and maybe some of our modification may become yours too.</p>

            <p>I spent about four weeks drawing up different floor plans and after buying our van it became obvious which plan to use. I then started a shopping list for Amazon and EBay. I created a work and purchase list so it was in the order in which the work had be done, which is really important!

                <p>Here is our van. A Nissan NV2500 HD. We looked for used but after a period of time we decided to bite the bullet and buy new. Dave Smith in East Spokane had what we were looking for and what we were willing to spend. The first change was to remove the floor mat and particle board panels from the van.</p>

                <p>The slider door window was the second step. I made a template per the instructions and copied it to the van so I could drill the first hole in our new van. Behold, a window in the van.</p>

                <p>The third round of holes are so we could mount the two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WindyNation-200-Watt-Solar-Panel/dp/B00JK12544/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1492965923&sr=8-3&keywords=windynation+200+watt+solar+panel+kit">100W Windy Nation Solar Panels</a> that will supplement our power usage and make us partially green-every little bit helps.</p>
                <p>I believe the last exterior hole will this one for a shore power drop. If we are running short of power in our battery we'll be able to charge things back up. It's always good to have a backup.</p>

                <p>These two pictures show the wiring routed through the ribs of the van so we can lay down the 3/8" Foil Double Bubble insulation. It's a moisture barrier and R6 rating. We'll also place foam paneling where we can and the rest will get foam from a can. Can hardly wait.</p>

                <p>This evening I decided to insulate and lay the OSB in preparation of the final wood laminate that will be going down very soon.  Also, I was getting very tired of the echo in the van without anything to dampen the road noise. Next I'll be insulating the rest of the van. </p>

                <p>Well we've started to insulate the van. I've had better jobs. The glue in a can isn't the best thing to work with, but oh well. Anyway, still have to do the sides with the bubble wrap its also a moisture barrier, and then we fill the big spaces with insulfoam. More pictures coming.</p>

                <p>We'll we have completed the insulation of the van. Yippee! So the doors will be finished with a grey carpet. That's why there is tape on them. It's used to blend the joints so the transitions don't show under the carpet. The floor and ceiling will be the next phase.</p>

                <p>Now that all the sheet metal cutting, wire routing, insulating, and the sub-floor have been completed the next phase can begin. We need to complete the carpeting of the slider door since Heidi and I've covered the rear doors - it was our first attempt to carpet doors and I think we did a okay job, for our first attempt. The next step will be the paneling of the ceiling and then laying the hardwood floor. We will then finish up with the paneling of the walls. Once those steps are complete we'll begin the work of framing out the sleeper sofa so I can complete the wiring of the van.</p>

                <p>I'll take this opportunity to give a brief layout of the living quarters part of the van wiring. The two 100W solar panels will do their part to charge the two 6V DC batteries wired in series so they produce 12V DC, and an AC to DC charger will supplement the charging of the batteries when shore power is available. The batteries will send power to the DC panel that will in-turn send power to the two LED lights, ceiling fan, and water pump. The battery will also send power to the 1500W pure sine inverter so it can power the refrigerator and any AC device that we may bring along like a computer. There are several on/off switches and many fuses too for our safety and the protection of  the components. More to come...</p>
