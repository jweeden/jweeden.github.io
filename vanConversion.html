		<p class="h4">Hello, I'm Dave.</p>
		<br class="clear">
		<p>My wife Heidi and I thought it would be great to get a tent trailer so we could travel more and to distant locations - much further than the three state area where we had grown up. The only problem was we owned two hybrid SUVs that had towing limits of 1500 pounds. We were unable to find a trailer that would fill our needs and could be towed by our SUV without killing its transmission and voiding the warranty. Our son Joseph mentioned that van conversions are a very popular way of camping and travelling so we begin the van conversion journey.</p>
	<p>With the help of Joseph, Heidi, and the web I spent a couple of months watching YouTube, looking at Pinterest, and reading quite a few articles dealing with the DIYs (Do it Yourselves) of van conversions. I won't go into the details of why we bought the van we did or the changes we are making, because our needs are different just as everyone who reads this Blog is different. Read on and maybe some of our modification may become yours too.</p>
	<p>I spent about four weeks drawing up different floor plans and after buying our van it became obvious which plan to use. I then started a shopping list for Amazon and EBay. I created a work and purchase list so it was in the order in which the work had be done, which is really important!</p>

			<p>Here is our van. A Nissan NV2500 HD. We looked for used but after a period of time we decided to bite the bullet and buy new. Dave Smith in East Spokane had what we were looking for and what we were willing to spend. The first change was to remove the floor mat and particle board panels from the van.</p>

			<h3>The Back Doors</h3>
			<small><em>May 7, 2017</em></small>
			<hr>
			<p>Now that all the sheet metal cutting, wire routing, insulating, and the sub-floor have been completed the next phase can begin. We need to complete the carpeting of the slider door since Heidi and I've covered the rear doors - it was our first attempt to carpet doors and I think we did a okay job, for our first attempt. The next step will be the paneling of the ceiling and then laying the hardwood floor. We will then finish up with the paneling of the walls. Once those steps are complete we'll begin the work of framing out the sleeper sofa so I can complete the wiring of the van.</p>
			<p>I'll take this opportunity to give a brief layout of the living quarters part of the van wiring. The two 100W solar panels will do their part to charge the two 6V DC batteries wired in series so they produce 12V DC, and an AC to DC charger will supplement the charging of the batteries when shore power is available. The batteries will send power to the DC panel that will in-turn send power to the two LED lights, ceiling fan, and water pump. The battery will also send power to the 1500W pure sine inverter so it can power the refrigerator and any AC device that we may bring along like a computer. There are several on/off switches and many fuses too for our safety and the protection of the components. More to come...</p>

			<h3>Ceiling Goes Up</h3>
			<small><em>May 17-21, 2017</em></small>
			<hr>
			<p>The ceiling is up, with the exception of the trim between panels. It will be added after the walls and cabinets have been installed. I've also got the backup camera installed. The first attempt was not good, the camera didn't work. However, the second choice has worked out great so far. It's a Yada digital wireless unit with a 4.3 inch monitor. The van came with backup sonar which is very handy, but not being able to see if someone is about to be ran over is worrisome. The camera takes that worry away. Mahogany paneling was used, and will be used for the walls too.</p>
			<p>My build plan's next step is to install the sofa/bed. All the electrical devices will be installed under the left side and storage will be under the right side. After the sofa is done we'll install the counter/vertical cabinet at the rear of the van. The counter segment will have the sink and a two burner stovetop with fresh water, grey water, and LP gas storage under the counter. The vertical cabinet section will contain the porta potty, 3 cubic foot fridge and a small cupboard above the fridge. There will also be the addition of two storage cabinets, then the finial trim to complete the conversion. We will post additional pictures as the work is completed.</p>

			<h3>Electrical and the Couch</h3>
			<small><em>June 10-11, 2017</em></small>
			<hr>
			<p>Well we finally got the Sofa/Bed frame finished. Once the frame was completed I could finish the installation of the electrical equipment. The parts include the 1500w inverter (that will power the 3 cubic foot fridge), the AC to DC charger that will supplement the charging of the batteries when power is available, and the DC fuse panel that provides power to the two LED lights, the fan, and the water pump. Finally, the Solar charger/controller that will charge the two 6v DC batteries wired in series so they provide 12v DC to the fuse panel. They were all tested and work. Makes me feel so good to get it right. Thanks Heidi and God. Lots of prayers that it would go well. So the final part of the sofa build will be to attach the back to the van wall and wrap the bed in Birch paneling with a stain and semi gloss coating that will match the trim. Heidi is in charge of buying the pads and having them wrapped in typical RV cloth/vinyl. The pads will be 4 or 5 inch memory foam. More pictures once the whole thing is completed.</p>

			<h3>Van Conversion 98% Complete</h3>
			<small><em>July 24-28, 2017</em></small>
			<hr>
			<p>Well the galley is complete, and the wheel wells have been covered and trimmed too. The partial 8"X10" wheel well between the sofa and the galley was covered by the Birch paneling because it blended so well. Also, I moved the solar controller to the top of the wheel well cover so it could be easily read, and I added a DC battery meter to check the condition of just the batteries. The passenger side wheel well was covered with the same material that was used on the floor so it would match the floor. Galley is done!</p>
			<p>We have 2 items on our list to fully complete the conversion. Finish the carpeting of the rear door frame on top-passenger side and the overhead storage above the sofa/bed.</p>
			<p>The carpet will likely be done before this update is posted. The overhead storage will be completed in a few weeks. We want to take the van on a shakedown outing so we can better determine how long; 3, 4, or 6 feet to make it. Some would say as big as possible, but we want to make sure just how much more space is needed and what it will be carrying so I can make changes to the construction of it.</p>
			<p>Attached is a breakout of the costs for this conversion. The power tools, blades, bits, and other items I already had and didn't increase the cost of the project. However, I bought a Router to do finish work on the galley and the sofa/bed. It was a good purchase.</p>
			<p>So in summary, I would say this was quit the experience. We have never done anything like this before. It took all the skills and help I could get to finish this. Heidi worked right along side of me. We are a team. Our friends offered tools I didn't have and most of all ideas or other ways to approach a design issue. Speaking of design, I heard and read it many times while investigating this process but I really didn't grasp just how much the shape of the van's walls and ceiling would impact my plans and carpentry skills. I've worked on many house remodels and builds but working on a non-square structure is a challenge to say the least. My drawings were the basic idea, however, every part of the process was altered. I would say that the only part of the conversion that was straight forward was the removal of the factory panel boards and floor mat from the cargo area. Would I do it again? Most likely no, but we plan to enjoy our van in its new role.</p>
