            <p>Hello, to begin with, I'm Dave. My wife Heidi and I thought it would be great to get a tent trailer so we could travel more and to distant locations - much further than the three state area where we had grown up. The only problem was we owned two hybrid SUVs that had towing limits of 1500 pounds. We were unable to find a trailer that would fill our needs and could be towed by our SUV without killing its transmission and voiding the warranty. Our son Joseph mentioned that van conversions are a very popular way of camping and travelling so we begin the van conversion journey.</p>

            <p>With the help of Joseph, Heidi, and the web I spent a couple of months watching YouTube, looking at Pinterest, and reading quite a few articles dealing with the DIYs (Do it Yourselves) of van conversions. I won't go into the details of why we bought the van we did or the changes we are making, because our needs are different just as everyone who reads this Blog is different. Read on and maybe some of our modification may become yours too.</p>

            <p>I spent about four weeks drawing up different floor plans and after buying our van it became obvious which plan to use. I then started a shopping list for Amazon and EBay. I created a work and purchase list so it was in the order in which the work had be done, which is really important! 
            </p>

            <p>Here is our van. A Nissan NV2500 HD. We looked for used but after a period of time we decided to bite the bullet and buy new. Dave Smith in East Spokane had what we were looking for and what we were willing to spend. The first change was to remove the floor mat and particle board panels from the van.

            <p>The slider door window was the second step. I made a template per the instructions and copied it to the van so I could drill the first hole in our new van. Behold, a window in the van.</p>

            <p>These two pictures show the wiring routed through the ribs of the van so we can lay down the 3/8" Foil Double Bubble insulation. It's a moisture barrier and R6 rating. We'll also place foam paneling where we can and the rest will get foam from a can. Can hardly wait.</p>

            <p>This evening I decided to insulate and lay the OSB in preparation of the final wood laminate that will be going down very soon.  Also, I was getting very tired of the echo in the van without anything to dampen the road noise. Next I'll be insulating the rest of the van. </p>
