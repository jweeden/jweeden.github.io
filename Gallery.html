    <h3>Sakura: Traditional Japanese Cuisine</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="infograph">I've wanted to make a sushi website since I was back in college, and just haven't done so before. I started by looking up various sources online, trying to find out what users tend to want most from a restaurant website. They all tended to share these top priorities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can easily view a menu, not in PDF</li>
      <li>Itâ€™s mobile-friendly</li>
      <li>Restaurant hours and location are shown and, if able, link out to maps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first iterations were too 'stereotypical', utilizing brush fonts to accentuate the 'authentic-ness' but really just made it look busy. The design was shifted from it's original concept, and moved into a more professional/upper-class one, keeping in mind the users complaints about other existing sites.

    <h3 class="spacer">'Spot!' Dog Breeder App</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="infographic">This is a site spurred on by my and my fiance's love of dogs, and the realization that there really aren't any well designed breeder sites, and to top that off, most other sites seem to never update, or are full of scams.</p>

    <div class="center">
      <img src="img/Spot/WebStarter 'Spot'_Planning.jpg" alt="Sakura Desktop Mock" class="center">
    </div>

    <p>This site set out to address those problems and create a site that gives breeders a reliable and easy way to communicate with prospective families and update litter status'. It also full fill's a similar roll for the average user, allowing them to create a profile to receive litter updates, and also communicate with the breeders about finding their newest family member.</p>

    </div>


    <p>Currently the site is a WIP, as it became a much bigger undertaking for one person than I had origionally thought, with it evolving from a simple website, to a website with profiles and breeder verification, to an app that accomplishes all of that, but in a more convenient and packaged way that allows everything to be streamlined.</p>

    <p>It's my hope that one day this app can really be made into something that really makes a difference. You can find the WIP, and eventually the full project<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/40274779/Spot-WIP" target="_blank" class="resume"> on Behance.</a></p>
